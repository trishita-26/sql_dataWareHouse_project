-- View Name   : gold.dim_products
-- Layer       : Gold (Dimensional Model)
-- Description : This view prepares the Product Dimension table
--               for analytical reporting. It enriches raw product 
--               data from CRM with category details from ERP, 
--               ensuring only active (non-ended) products are 
--               included.
-- Transformation Logic:
--   1. Generates a surrogate product_id using ROW_NUMBER().
--   2. Joins CRM product info with ERP category lookup.
--   3. Filters out products where 'prd_end_dt' is not null.
